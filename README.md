# MyTime

Time management made simple. Easily track the time spent on each of your project. Available on iOS and watchOS.

MyTime lets you track your time in a simple and intuitive way:
- Create a timer, start tracking you time and visualize it on the day circle view. 
- Tap anywhere on the day circle view and edit or create a timer interval. 
- See all your stats on the Stats tab, and visualize the time spent on each project on the circle view.
- Start a timer directly from the Today Extension in the Today View on your iPhone, or with Haptic Touch. 

MyTime is also an independent watchOS app: 
- Create new timers from your wrist. 
- Start and stop timers at a glance. 
- Keep track of the time spent on each project during the day. 

Everything is synced seamlessly between your iOS devices and Apple Watch with iCloud.
